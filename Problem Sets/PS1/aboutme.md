(a) I have a good deal of programming experience in Python, having used it very extensively for physics and astronomy research for almost three years now. So I would say I'm quite familiar with Python and NumPy/SciPy. I have previously been exposed to C# programming (a brief attempt to make video games in Unity) and some JavaScript

(b) I'm familiar with matrix algebra from taking linear algebra and some use in research and physics classes. I'm familiar with probability density functions from taking quantum mechanics. I'm familiar with ODEs from taking differential equations and from physics classes.

(c) No for all of them.

(d) I would love to learn more about machine learning; I have a little bit of experience previously in Python using the Keras library, but have no idea what is going on under the surface. I would also like to learn about how MCMC algorithms work. These are two things that I've seen come up a lot in physics applications.
